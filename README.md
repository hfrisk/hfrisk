# Greetings!

Hi, my name is Hunter Frisk. I'm a computer science and information technology student at Concordia University-Saint Paul. I'm currently working on a small personal website generator, and also have an interest in smart home systems and automation. 

## Technologies and Tools

### Programming Languages

* Lua/Luau :heart:
* Rust
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Java
* Kotlin
* Python

### Tools

* Neovim :heart:
* VS Code
* IntelliJ
* Docker/Podman
* Nginx :heart:
* Asciidoc

## Currently working on

* **Unnamed Website Generator**: Existing static site generators like Jekyll and Antora are great, but I wanted to make my own for a personal website. Generates a homepage with links to markdown files, sorted by last-modified. 
* **Random Notification Daemons**: Small background scripts which randomly send me notifications on Windows and Linux. Both read from a directory of plaintext files, and serve their contents as system tray notifications. Re-writing these as a single cross-platform Rust application before I publish them.
